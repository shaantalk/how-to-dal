### Steps from application to admit for Dal's MACS program
1. Apply
2. After 2-5 days you will get a mail for GradApp. Upload your docs and add your referee details for LORs
3. After 2-3 days you will get a mail for setting up the interview. Choose a date in the link provided in the mail.
4. Take the interview
5. Within 2-3 days you will be recommended and you will get a mail from the CS Faculty
6. After 2-3 days to a week of recommendation you will get the offer letter. They send out offer letters only on Tuesdays and Thrusdays ( AST Timezone )

### Got recommended ? But don't know you will get admit or not ?

This is all we know about who is 100% getting offer letter

Only if all three of the below conditions r satisfied

1. Got recommendation letter via mail
2. GradApp portal open with "recommendation" tab selected
3. DalOnline portal says "Deposit Requested"

### For rejection cases this is what I have observed for MACS program.

Scene 1:
GradApp portal status goes from under review to direct recommendation without interview.

Scene 2:
GradApp portal goes from under review to recommendation status but haven't got any email with recommendation letter pdf.
